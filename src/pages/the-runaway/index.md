**She always knew what she wanted, but it wasn't what she needed.**

Being stranded in a small town was not a part of Charlotte Harcotte’s plans. After a minor car accidents left her stuck in some backwater, one-horse town, her chances of becoming Mrs. Nick Rutherford seemed slim to none.

In just a week, the little town managed to steal her heart… _and so has a handsomely rugged hotel owner._

Now, Charlotte is stuck in more ways than one. Her would-be fiance doesn’t seem so nice after all and the life of luxury she’s worked so hard for suddenly seems like a burden. Caught between two worlds, Charlotte must choose between the life she knows and the life her heart really wants.

Funny, endearing and heart-warming, _The Runaway_ is N. Franko’s first full-length, standalone novel.
