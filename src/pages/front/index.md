    **From Riches to rags….to true love? Could her childhood friend be the key to getting her fortune back?**

    Money never mattered to flighty millionaire socialite Stacey Holiday. She didn’t think much of her grandmother leaving her the entire Holiday fortune in her will—until her father was arrested and her assets frozen. 

    Now, Stacey needs the money more than ever. There’s just one catch: she must find a husband before she can get her hands on the money! 

    When her childhood friend Logan pops back into her life, they reconnect in more ways than one and Stacey thinks he just may be The One. But, her family has other plans for Stacey and the Holiday fortune she’s set to inherit. 

    Caught between family obligation and following her heart, will Stacey choose riches, rags or true love?

    Technically Speaking is a fast-paced, laugh-out-loud romantic comedy with more sweetness than you can handle. It is book two of N. Franko’s Romantic Comedy of Errors, but can be read alone and in any order.
