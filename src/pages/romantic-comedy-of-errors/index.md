        **He’s a bad boy movie star. I'm just a failed reporter. This assignment
        was supposed to be temporary. So why does it feel like our love isn’t
        just scripted?**


        After being fired from my job as a reporter and finding my boyfriend
        cheating on me, I figured I owed it to myself to have a public meltdown.
        I just didn’t expect it to be in front of Hollywood’s biggest, most
        egotistical movie star, Ryan Vexler—or the paparazzi, who plastered my
        photo all over the tabloids and called me is girlfriend!


        Now, I’m trying to navigate this strange world of Hollywood glitz and
        glamour because Ryan needs to clean up his public image. For some
        reason, he thinks I’m the one to do just that. What he doesn’t know is
        that I’m a failure. I failed as a musician. I failed as a reporter. Now
        I’m failing as a fake girlfriend because my feelings for this man are
        _very, very real._


        If you like your romcoms to be laugh-out-loud with a few twists and
        turns and a touch of sweetness, then you’ll love N. Franko’s debut
        novella, _Technically Scripted_, book one of the _Romantic Comedy of
        Errors_.

      title: Technically Speaking

        **Money never mattered to millionaire socialite, Stacey Holiday—until she lost it all!**


        My grandmother, the great Gladys Gladwell Holiday and I were never really close, but when she died, I still mourned her the only way I knew how: wine straight from the bottle and randomly texting HottGuy69 on an anonymous dating site.


        It was nice of Grandmother to leave me everything she owned to inherit on my wedding day, but it wasn’t like I needed the money. **_Except, my father was just arrested and my family’s assets are now frozen so yes, I very much need Grandma’s money!_**


        Then, my childhood friend, Logan, suddenly pops back into my life.


        _Logan._


        TThe sweet, humble, chubby, Italian kid who worked for my grandmother turned into a hot, sexy specimen of a man and we reconnected in more ways then one.


        Then, my family pushes him away and for good, this time. I never thought I would ever see him again. That is, until I learned the identity of HottGuy69…


        _Technically Speaking_ is a fast-paced, laugh-out-loud romantic comedy with more sweetness than you can handle. It is book two of N. Franko’s _Romantic Comedy of Errors_, but can be read alone and in any order.

      subtitle: One More Romantic Comedy of Errors
      title: Technically Married
      description: >-

        **What drove them apart might just be what brings them back together again.**


        Former punk rocker Valerie spent her days searching for something she’s never had—a stable relationship. She found some semblance of it with her incredibly sexy boss but there’s just one problem, _technically she’s already married to a starving artist musician._


        When her former best friend invited her to her celebrity wedding to Hollywood movie star, Ryan Vexler, Valerie saw it as a chance to finally confront her estranged husband and get that divorce. She got more than what she bargained for when she finally learned the truth about the ending of their marriage.


        Now, the rock star she’s spent her days running away from awakened something inside her. Valerie thought she could deny who she really was—and who she really loved—but she suddenly realizes that she doesn’t want to. And it feels so good!


        If you like your romcoms with rock stars, a few celebrities and a whole lot of laughs, you’ll love _Technically Married_, book 3 in the Romantic _Comedy of Errors series_ by author N. Franko.
